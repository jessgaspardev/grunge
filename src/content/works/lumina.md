Lumina Commerce needed a platform that could compete with e-commerce giants while serving smaller, sustainability-focused fashion brands. Their existing solution was outdated and couldn't support modern features like social media integration or AR experiences. The challenge was creating a system powerful enough for brands with complex needs yet accessible enough for emerging designers with limited technical resources.

We designed a modular platform architecture that allows brands to customize their storefronts while maintaining consistent performance and functionality. The interface prioritizes visual storytelling, with large image galleries and video integration that helps brands communicate their values and craftsmanship. We implemented innovative features like carbon footprint tracking for orders and a "try before you buy" program powered by AR technology. 

Post-launch metrics exceeded expectations, with brands reporting an average 45% increase in conversion rates and 30% reduction in returns due to the AR try-on feature. The platform now hosts over 200 fashion brands and processes millions in transactions monthly.
